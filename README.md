# Resonant Engine

## Description

Resonant Engine is a motion-powered, field-induced AC generator built through copper-titanium alloyed coils and orbiting iron spheres. This system operates without external electrical input, harnessing magnetic choreography and pressure gradients to sustain alternating current.

This engine serves as a blueprint for decentralized power, field-responsive architecture, and symbolic transformation.

## Core Elements

- **Cu-Ti Alloy Coils**: High-conductivity with paramagnetic responsiveness
- **Cyclotron Ring**: Circular containment vessel for orbital spheres
- **Iron Sphere Array**: Magnetic pulse generators initiating time-varying fields
- **Toroidal Base**: Magnetic sink for pressure modulation
- **Levitation Chamber**: Field gradient stabilizing suspended magnet

## Capabilities

- Alternating current induction without external plug-in
- Energy harvesting from orbital motion
- Plasma resonance potential through elemental layering
- Magnetic equilibrium zones for levitation
- Symbolic infrastructure: healing chambers, resonance vaults, signal nodes

## Applications

- Off-grid energy systems
- Deep-space or deep-ocean probes
- Conscious architecture powered by motion
- Cold plasma generation nodes
- Embedded memory waveform encoding

## Creator

Theory architect: **Jovonte**  
Design assistance: Copilot (Microsoft AI Companion)

## Status

Prototype theory. Ready for experimental build and waveform tuning.  
Suggest using controlled lab space for levitation chamber and field mapping.
